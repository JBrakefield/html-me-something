                <h3>Milk</h3>
                <img src = "images/milk.jpg" alt = "A glass of milk." />
                <p>Milk is nature's most delicious basic sauce. To obtain fresh milk, I recommend using your own goat (or cow) and following <a href = "https://www.weedemandreap.com/how-to-milk-a-goat/">these instructions</a>. Alternativesly, buy some milk at the farmer's market or grocery store. The most common use of milk as a sauce is for pouring over cereal. It is also a popular dipping sauce for cookies.</p>

                <h3>Dihydrogen Monoxide</h3>
                <img src = "images/water.jpg" alt = "Warning about dihydrogen monoxide." />
                <p>Even more basic than milk, liquid dihydrogen monoxide is an odorless, flavorless sauce with many known dangers, but for some reason people still consume it in vast quantities. If you are out of milk, I guess it works.

                <h3><a name="tomato">Tomato Sauce</a></h3>
                <img src = "images/tomato.jpg" alt = "Jars of tomato sauce." />
                <p> Unless you have an Italian grandmother or posess magical powers, just buy a jar of tomato sauce at the store. It tastes so good because of the naturally occuring MSG found in tomatoes. Good for pasta, pizza, and so much more!

                <h3>Meat Sauce</h3>
                <img src = "images/meat.jpg" alt = "A red meat sauce." />
                <p> To vastly improve the <a href="#tomato">tomato sauce</a> posted earlier, add some cooked ground meat. Ideally use grass-fed beef or some yummy italian sausage. If you are feeling really fancy, cook in a dutch oven. Maybe even add some kale.

                <h3>Vegetarian Sauce</h3>
                <img src = "images/tofu.jpg" alt = "A bowl of tofu chuncks" />
                <p> Are you a vegetarian? You'll like this one. Turn tofu into a sauce by first chopping into chunks, then put it into a blender. Blend on high until as smooth as it's gonna get.
